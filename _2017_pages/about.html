      &emsp; In order to seize the opportunities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development and to promote industrial 
      transformation and local economic development, Jilin University established the School of Artificial Intelligence 
      on May 26, 2018. The establishment of the School of Artificial Intelligence aims to implement the “New Generation 
      Artificial Intelligence Development Plan”, and “University Innovative Artificial Intelligence Plan”. Our mission is 
      to promote technological innovation in the field of AI, push the frontier of AI research, and cultivate engineering 
      & research talents for national AI strategy.

      Jilin University was one of the earliest units that engaged in AI research in China. In 1977, Academician of Chinese 
      Academy of Sciences, Prof. Xiang-Hao Wang, took the leading role of artificial intelligence research in China. It has 
      been more than 40 years since Jilin University started systematical research in AI, that leaves this university a 
      strong foundation in research and education. As of today, the advantages of inter-disciplines are more prominent, 
      since Jilin University can actively expand the field of Artificial Intelligence with the solid base and rapid 
      development of computer science, mathematics, information engineering, control science, etc. <br><br>

      <!-- &emsp; Professor Yi Chang, Dean of the School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University, is a Chinese National 
      Distinguished Professor in 2017, a British Computer Society (BCS) Fellow, an ACM Distinguished Scientist, and a 
      well-known scholar in the field of Artificial Intelligence. He was a research director of Yahoo Research, a Technical 
      Vice President of Huawei Research America. He has published more than 100 papers in top conferences or journals and 
      won the Best Paper Award on ACM KDD'2016 and ACM WSDM'2016. He served as one of the conference General Chairs for 
      ACM WSDM'2018, and he will serve as one of the conference General Chairs for ACM SIGIR'2020. <br><br> -->

      &emsp; The School of Artificial Intelligence will start with a high standard by integrating available resources. We will 
      not only collaborate with the existing AI-related academic and talent advantages of the university, but also explore 
      new modes of AI development in the new era. At present, we are building a comprehensive system with a strong academic 
      background, and looking for a new path of progression, thus we can make positive contributions to the country's 
      initiative in the new round of international technology competition. The School of Artificial Intelligence will 
      seize the historical opportunity, breakthrough AI core technologies, and finally, develop a competitive institute 
      in the future of Artificial Intelligence. <br><br> </p>

      <h2 class="second">About JLU</h2>

      <p>Jilin University, located in Changchun City, Jilin Province, was founded in 1946. It is a key comprehensive university under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, and strongly supported by China’s “Project 211” and “Project 985”. In 2000, Jilin University merged with the former Jilin University of Technology, the former Norman Bethune University of Medical Sciences, the former Changchun University of Science and Technology and Changchun Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. In 2004, the former University of Military Logistics also joined. Jilin University offers a wide range of disciplines, including 43 colleges or schools, covering 13 academic categories, namely, philosophy, economics, law, education, literature, history, science, engineering, military science, medical studies, management, and art. There are 129 undergraduate programs, 304 accredited postgraduate programs, 244 accredited doctoral programs and 42 centers for post-doctoral studies, 47 first-class university and discipline construction projects.</p>
